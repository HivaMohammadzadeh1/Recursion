# Recursion
A menu-driven program with the following options
To call a  recursive function, which raises a number to the power(whole number)
Must work for negative as well as positive values. 
Ask a user for the values of the base and  the power
To call a recursive function, that produce  the sum of the squares  for the first n terms of the series (1*1)+(2*2)+(3*3)+...(n*n)-[staring with 1]
Output sample: 1+(2*2)+(3*3)= 14; output to be produced by the recursive function
Positive numbers only
Ask a user for the number of terms
To call a recursive  function to add the first n terms of the series (n*n)+...+(3*3)+(2*2)+(1*1) [ starting with n]
Output sample (3*3)+(2*2) +1 =14; output to be produced by the recursive function
Positive numbers only
Ask a user for the number of terms to quit

Notes:

Ask a user for the values of n and x
Validate all user inputs
User should be able to run menu as many times as user wants
